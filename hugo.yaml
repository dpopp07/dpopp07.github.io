    content: |-
      I am a software engineer and team lead at IBM Cloud working in the API space, with a particular focus on developer experience,
      interface design, and client library integrations. I've had the opportunity to lead several impactful, cross-functional projects
      such as an application that generates CLI and Terraform integrations from API specifications, automation that provides API design
      feedback for Cloud services, and a system that unifies error handling experiences across IBM Cloud services and tools.

      Outisde of software, I'm a musician and recording enginner. You can check out some of the music I've worked on by clicking the
      Spotify logo above. I'm also something of a serial hobbyist. I enjoy making (and eating) ice cream, studying theology and
      philosophy, and developing craft cocktail recipes. The unifying factor among my work and diverse interests is the
      intersection of art and science. I love exercising both sides of my brain in all that I do.

      Most of all, though I'm introvert, I love working with and being around people. Thanks for visiting my site, and feel free to say hey!
